# Enhanced Multi-Type DDoS Attack Detection Using Machine Learning Techniques

## Introduction
This repository houses a cutting-edge project focused on detecting and classifying various types of Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks through advanced machine learning techniques. Our approach extends beyond traditional binary detection methods, aiming to pinpoint specific types of DDoS attacks to bolster cybersecurity defenses.

## Project Components
1. **Feature Selection**: Implementing various feature selection methods, including filter, wrapper, and embedded techniques, to identify critical features for DDoS detection.
2. **Ensemble Methods**: Harnessing the power of ensemble methods like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Stacking to distinguish between different DDoS attack categories effectively.
3. **Data Handling Strategies**: Addressing real-world dataset complexities with strategies that mitigate data deficiencies and enhance the models' generalization capabilities.
4. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Employing key cybersecurity metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC for rigorous system effectiveness testing.
5. **Performance Improvement**: Demonstrating a significant improvement over baseline methods, our approach highlights a 2% enhancement in model performance.

## Repository Structure
- `/src`: Contains all source code, including scripts for machine learning models and feature selection algorithms.
- `/data`: Sample datasets used in the project.
- `/results`: Results of the model evaluations, comparisons, and visualizations.
- `/docs`: the project Documentation.

## Getting Started
To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
3. Navigate to the `/src` directory and run the main script.
